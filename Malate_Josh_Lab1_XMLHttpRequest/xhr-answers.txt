What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest? 
ready state shows the request progress while the status shows the result from the server whether its successful or not.
How can you make the request asynchronous? 
by putting true in the third parameter in xhr.open().
Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?
So that the page doesnt freeze when waiting for the data making it smoother.
